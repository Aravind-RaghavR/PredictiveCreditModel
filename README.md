# PredictiveCreditModel

## Overview

**PredictiveCreditModel** is a machine learning project designed to predict loan approvals and assess credit risk using historical loan data. The project applies various machine learning algorithms to forecast the likelihood of loan approval based on applicant features and financial metrics.

## Objectives

- **Predict Loan Approval**: Develop a predictive model to forecast the likelihood of loan approval.
- **Assess Credit Risk**: Evaluate credit risk by analyzing key factors that influence loan outcomes.
- **Enhance Decision-Making**: Provide insights to improve loan processing and risk assessment.

## Methods

### Data Preparation

1. **Data Loading**: Import and inspect the dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values by imputing with mean or mode, and preprocess categorical features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features and apply log transformations for normalization.

### Data Exploration

- **Visualizations**: Analyze the distribution of key features and correlations using histograms and heatmaps.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examine relationships between features to understand their impact on loan approval.

### Model Building

1. **Preprocessing**: Encode categorical variables and prepare the dataset for machine learning models.
2. **Model Training**: Train various models including:
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Logistic Regression
3. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, and cross-validation.

### Results

- **Model Performance**: Summarize the accuracy and effectiveness of each trained model.
- **Confusion Matrix Insights**: Visualize confusion matrices to understand model performance and errors.
- **Feature Importance**: Highlight key features that influence loan approval predictions.
